Karratha police arrest 20 @-@ year @-@ old after high speed motorcycle chase
a motorcycle has been seized after it was ridden at 125km / h in a 70km / h zone and through bushland to escape police in the Pilbara .
traffic police on patrol in Karratha this morning tried to pull over a blue motorcycle when they spotted it reaching 125km / h as it pulled out of a service station on Bathgate Road .
police say the rider then failed to stop and continued on to Burgess Road before turning into bushland , causing the officers to lose sight of it .
the motorcycle and a person matching the description of the rider was then spotted at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra .
Karratha Police have charged a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man with failing to stop and reckless driving .
he is due to appear in Karratha Magistrates Court on September 23 .
the motorcycle was seized and impounded for three months .

George Webster , 28 , faced the charges during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow .
he is alleged to have raped a woman at the Scotland &apos;s Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7 , 2013 .
it is claimed Webster attacked her while she was &quot; unconscious , asleep and incapable of giving consent . &quot;
Webster is then charged with raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Highlands on May 4 , 2014 .
judge Lady Rae set a trial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh .
reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
&quot; as go unions , so go middle @-@ class jobs , &quot; says Ellison , the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co @-@ chair .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis .
this ground @-@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti @-@ union forces in their tracks
amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
but it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea .
despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights .
there was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo &apos;s militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . &quot;
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler &apos;s fascism was replaced with muscular democracy .
recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : &quot; the right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful .
when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant , Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . &quot;
for generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
as the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
by raising the living standards of millions , labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production .
those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history remembers them .
history remembers , as should we .
the formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
a U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state .
the measure , signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
however , the judge &apos;s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges .
&quot; plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , &quot; Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision .
a hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
abortion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
&quot; today &apos;s ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , &quot; said Nancy Northup , president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clinics .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges .
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi .
key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday .
abortion rights campaigners , along with the American College of obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors .
anti @-@ abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women &apos;s health , though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics .
only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Reproductive Rights said .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
in arguing against the ruling , Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007 .
women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts .
researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
lead researcher Susan Jordan , of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
small STUDY : new drugs may slow lung , ovarian cancer
the researchers tracked the women &apos;s medical journeys across seven years .
Dr Jordan said a woman &apos;s age at the time of diagnosis , ovarian cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio @-@ economic status also impacted on survival chances .
older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they &apos;re mostly based in major cities , &quot; she said .
despite improving tele @-@ medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance , she suggested more fly @-@ in , fly @-@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long @-@ term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the research , funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centres rue fall in homeowners
the drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core gardening age group , &quot; according to the HTA &apos;s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
according to the report , people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
it cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens , the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain &apos;s lowest spend per household on gardening products .
the HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
guy Barter , chief horticultural adviser to the RHS , said : &quot; container gardening , for example , is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate . &quot;
the HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector &apos;s &apos; golden age &quot; as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid @-@ 1990s .
it also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year .
in Pakistan , the protest movement led by political opponent , Imran Khan , and the spiritual leader , Tahirul Qadri , continues .
in the capital city of Islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators stormed the government @-@ run television station , PTV .
however , information minister , Pervaiz Rashid , said that soldiers had been able to force the protesters back out of the building .
the TV station stopped broadcasting for approximately 40 minutes , but has since begun to broadcast again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the official residency of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif .
approximately one kilometre away , they clashed with security security services , armed with sticks and stones .
the police used tear gas .
the demonstrators demanded Sharif &apos;s resignation , which he refused .
the Pakistan Army called for a political solution to the conflict &quot; without delay and without resorting to violence . &quot;
following a meeting at its headquarters on Sunday evening , the military announced : &quot; the Army remains committed to its task of ensuring security for the State . &quot;
the military plays an important role in Pakistan and has taken power by force several times in the past .
the opposition politician , Imran Khan , accuses Prime Minister Sharif of rigging the parliamentary elections , which took place in May last year .
the protests escalated at the weekend , after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to advance to Sharif &apos;s residence .
there were three people killed .
Turkey Summons US Diplomat Over Spying Report
the Turkish foreign ministry has summoned the most senior U.S. diplomat in the country for clarification of a report about American and British spying in Turkey .
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d &apos;affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news wires , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spied on each other .
an earlier report that Germany &apos;s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more angry response from the Turkish government .
warning strike : train drivers threaten to strike , causing problems for commuters
the nationwide waning strike made by train drivers on Monday evening could also have a negative impact on passenger services in NW .
the announced walkout will last for between 18 and 21 hours , will affect all transport companies across Germany , including main @-@ line rail , regional trains and city trains ,
the brunt of the strike will affect the transport of goods .
image : A. Burgi / Archive
according to the announcement made in Düsseldorf by the district chairperson for the union of German train drivers ( GDL ) , Sven Schmitte .
we are expecting there to be a significant amount of cancellations .
we are not targeting any regions .
the brunt of the strike will affect the transport of goods .
Deutsch Bahn in NW has announced that they will do everything they can to ensure disruptions are kept to a minimum .
the GDL have not said , however , where they will strike , making it difficult to predict exactly what the consequences will be .
Magaluf police chief charged over corruption
the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca &apos;s public prosecutor &apos;s office on Friday .
the head of Calvià police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot of Magaluf .
chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most of Magaluf &apos;s bars and nightclubs are located .
according to online daily Mallorca Diario , the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca &apos;s anti @-@ corruption prosecutor on Friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro .
Spanish national daily ABC reported the disgruntled nightclub owners as saying favouritism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
&quot; it &apos;s not about making money anymore , it &apos;s about surviving , &quot; one of the businessmen told the court .
you don &apos;t mess with our livelihoods .
we have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer as a result of a viral YouTube video which showed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old British holidaymaker performing fellatio on 24 men during a pub crawl .
island authorities have since attempted to clamp down on the drunk and disorderly behaviour of Magaluf holiday revellers by minimizing numbers on the notorious alcohol @-@ fuelled bar crawls .
in addition , the Playhouse club where the fellatio incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Playhouse and the bar crawl organizers Carnage were jointly fined € 55,000 ( $ 73,000 ) .
the tourist resort of Magaluf , mainly popular with young British holidaymakers , has also seen numerous alcohol @-@ fuelled accidents involving the craze known as &quot; balconing , &quot; where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
first day of spring marked with wet and blustery conditions impacting Adelaide Airport flights
spring has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport .
a further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm , following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
the latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short , blustery showers , including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes .
after winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city .
the squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
the plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
wind gusts were reaching about 50km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time .
flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.
that flight &apos;s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney .
a top of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday , with the chance of a shower or two .
Matthies thinks : high time for the Internet Of Things
faced with runaway advances in consumer technology , which threaten to turn our homes into high @-@ tech control rooms , our reporter , Bernd Matthies , takes heart from one electronic gadget that he really feels at home with .
as I write this , my eye catches the spiral cable , which connects the handset to the telephone , and I &apos;m thinking : WoW ! how retro is that then ?
but it started me thinking : if the cable was not there , all the handsets would be lying scattered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more retro .
in any case , in the elephantine ( elephantine ?
no - a typing error - electronics ) sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rubbish tomorrow - once bought , it &apos;s out of date .
and anyone , for example , who still has an old CRT TV in their living room , is merely announcing to the world that they &apos;re not interested in TVs !
so why these thoughts ?
because the International Consumer Electronics Fair ( IFA ) in Berlin , once again showed us how incompetent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
the layman , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a CD @-@ Player , is today faced with highfalutin expert talk about an array of gadgets , the purpose of which he doesn &apos;t even understand . &quot; connected Home , wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies , &quot; are what the press office promise us .
yes - and ?
what do you say to people , who clearly talk such guff voluntarily ?
really , they &apos;ve been trying to sell us the Internet of Things for our homes , for the last 20 years .
so that your yoghurt can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fire @-@ alarm can tell you - when you &apos;re lying on the beach in the Maldives - that there &apos;s a fire in your study back home .
and wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if we could set our home air @-@ conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
yes - but that presupposes that you have an air @-@ conditioner in the first place .
however , one dream really will come true very soon : we lift our wrist watches , and in a loud voice say &quot; Vacuum ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot begins to hoover .
fantastic .
everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the boundary between white and brown goods is becoming blurred , &quot; mutters an industry insider . you can connect your washing machine to your headphone ; your steam oven can send you a weather report ; and your data @-@ goggles can tell you how long your pizza still has to go in the oven - but that &apos;s of little use if you &apos;re sitting in a traffic jam .
from everyday experience , we also know : if you need a new model gadget to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will out @-@ live the next IFA exhibits in Berlin .
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50 @-@ day Israel @-@ Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting .
the start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket @-@ scarred communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
in the southern city of Ashdod , employees at the &quot; Pashosh &quot; kindergarten , which was struck by a rocket , removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students &apos; arrival .
&quot; we are a little scared but we are excited , &quot; said Ronit Bart , a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school .
a lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
her 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Shani Bart , said it felt a &quot; little bit weird &quot; to suddenly be going back to school .
&quot; there were some difficult times and we didn &apos;t leave our houses at all , &quot; she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
until a cease @-@ fire halted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire .
many residents of Nahal Oz , a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell , are hesitant about coming back .
the Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned .
their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
he urged the children to study hard and said &quot; we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open @-@ ended truce last Tuesday .
the cease @-@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved , such as Hamas &apos; demand for the lifting of an Israel @-@ Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza &apos;s air and seaports .
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
the war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three @-@ quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children , according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
the Israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters .
with tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world &apos;s children and Jewish children , &quot; said Mohammad Amara , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
following the election in Saxony : CDU Vice @-@ Chairman Strobl questions NPD @-@ banning process
in view of the loss of votes by the German right @-@ wing extremist party , NPD , in Saxony , the national CDU @-@ Vice @-@ Chairman , Thomas Strobl , has called for an end of the on @-@ going NPD @-@ banning process , which is taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CDU National Vice @-@ Chairman , Thomas Strobl , the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the NPD from the political process , should be brought to an end .
according to the &quot; Leipziger Volkszeitung , &quot; the NPD performed worse than last time , &quot; said Strobl , who is also CDU regional boss in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
that is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the NPD in the ballot box , and not in the constitutional court .
on Sunday , the NPD narrowly missed achieving the five percent barrier , which would have seen it enter parliament .
a first attempt at securing a ban of the right @-@ wing extremist party failed in 2003 , because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had informants in the top echelons of the NPD .
in December 2013 the Bundesrat submitted a further banning action to the constitutional court , which is based in Karlsruhe , after spending a long time preparing the case .
the German government and Bundestag did not take part in the banning submission .
Harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees at Neuländer Platz will now be accommodated in tents .
the reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full @-@ to @-@ bursting .
the German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go @-@ ahead for the Red Cross to erect the three tents .
the local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
&quot; these one @-@ off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner , &quot; said , for example , Britta Herrmann , Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly .
her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for the over @-@ crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a widely @-@ watched gauge .
the RP Data CoreLogic hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , RP data said on Monday .
the rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not evenly spread across the country .
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market .
the RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year , while Melbourne &apos;s were up by 11.7 per cent .
the next strongest markets were Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , with price rises averaging between five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale was Canberra , hit by government spending cutbacks , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a &quot; real test &quot; for the market .
&quot; considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it &apos;s likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months , &quot; he said .
in an announcement to the regional German newspaper &apos; die Neue Presse &apos; Pötzl contradicted the comments of managing director , Peer Medau , and said that the latter was behaving like a &quot; military general . &quot;
this was not the style of the college , he said .
he said that the Medau family &quot; were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June .
they are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July . &quot;
at the same time he also said that the plans were not about &quot; final decisions already made , &quot; but rather about &quot; stating preferences . &quot;
he also said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Medaus feared .
it was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine metre @-@ wide road .
we currently aim to widen it by 5.5 metres , which is one metre wider than before , &quot; explained Pötzl .
Pötzl refutes the argument of the Medau concern , namely that its cost @-@ free parking places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
it won &apos;t be a case of everywhere being parked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
think of the neighbours
the children &apos;s nursery Bergwichtel , which is situated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run , is &quot; not to be impacted &quot; according to the college president .
he is far more concerned to point out &quot; that it &apos;s not only an issue concerning the children &apos;s nursery , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich @-@ Streib @-@ Strasse and the 800 schoolchildren of the adjacent secondary school .
it &apos;s therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Medau gentlemen , &quot; he said .
whether the criticism by the parents &apos; association for the children &apos;s nursery is correct that the extension of the road will lead to &quot; one of the few remaining natural spaces in Coburg being lost , &quot; he said the &quot; readers can decide for themselves . &quot;
at the beginning of October , Pötzl , together with the Bamberg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 &quot; and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . &quot;
peer Medau informed the parents of the children &apos;s nursery about the plans , last week .
accordingly , the access for the new parking level will not now lead , as before , via the campus and Friedrich @-@ Streib @-@ Strasse , but rather via the Medau @-@ Berg .
thus , the narrow road must be widened into two lanes over a stretch of about one kilometre .
according to higher estimates of the Medaus , the traffic in the Hohenfels castle park would increase ten @-@ fold .
they are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
Glandorf retires from German National Handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the German National team .
the 31 year @-@ old from German Bundesliga side SG Flensburg @-@ Handewitt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
&quot; it was not an easy decision to make , but I &apos;ve been thinking about it for months .
the time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career , &quot; announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Facebook @-@ Page .
he retires from international competition with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany .
the powerful @-@ throwing right @-@ back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champions @-@ League winners from Flensburg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach , Dagur Sigurdsson .
Glandorf said he had had a &quot; nice long talk &quot; with the Icelander , who will select his squad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland .
his ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as I am sure they will also inspire my long @-@ term teammates and my successors , too .
&quot; I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team wouldn &apos;t allow me to do that . &quot;
the left @-@ hander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a heel infection .
due to achilles tendon problems he was given a cortisone injection by doctors working with the German Handball Association , and this caused severe swelling of his foot .
he needed an emergency operation and two further surgeries as well .
Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
twelve years as a professional and eleven years with the national team would take their toll on any player .
&quot; I have some health issues I can &apos;t ignore anymore .
after three foot @-@ surgeries within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by infections , I have never been able to control my blood pressure .
I &apos;ve also got some other minor issues related - wear and tear .
at the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head , but I couldn &apos;t play tricks with my body , &quot; he explained in an interview with German magazine Handball Time .
he would only consider a comeback if really necessary .
&quot; if we are in real big trouble , then I might consider it , &quot; the two @-@ time father told the magazine .
&quot; but I can count the years I will continue to play handball with one hand .
and I have to admit that I have become really humble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
after my career I would like to walk straight , to be honest . &quot;
besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champions League in May and the EHF @-@ Cup in 2008 ( HSG Nordhorn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) .
he also won the Cup Winners Cup with Flensburg in 2012 .
German economy as shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
the crises around the globe have put a curb on the German economy in the the second quarter .
the Gross Domestic Product sank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
this was announced by the German Office for National Statistics , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
consumption alone was a spur to the economy in the early part of the year , whilst investments were down .
foreign goods trade had slowed , too .
due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half @-@ year GDP were up 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of &quot; Münsterland @-@ mooiste , &quot; which lead through the city on Sunday .
the city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot; Fietzen riders &quot; on Sunday .
the largest cycling federation in Holland , NTFU , staged the so @-@ called &quot; Münsterlande @-@ mooiste . &quot;
in other words , the largest bike ride straight through Münsterland , a bike rider &apos;s paradise close to Holland .
by registering , more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for having organized this tour through Münsterland .
the tour was advertised in several professional journals , and offered to those interested .
we are from Den Helder , and drove here over night so we could take part in the tour .
we would also like to get know Münsterland a bit better in the same way , &quot; the cyclists eagerly said , looking forward to the route through Steinfurt , Borken and Coesfeld .
after registering at the fraternity &apos;s club house , Sta .
Katharina started off with a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city and over the embankment , which is also where the start line was .
then , the route , which was advertised in three different categories , headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld , passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck , and then back to Horstmar .
the riders prove just how good a shape they are in : stretches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1175 meters , 120 kilometers with an altitude of 1475 meters , and 145 kilometers with an altitude of 1775 meters .
they were fed and watered on their way back in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
chief organizer , Jos ter Huerne , and deputy mayor , Heinz Lölfing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
the organization went smoothly , with no issues , and there were no nasty incidents , &quot; Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event .
unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped for , which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
&quot; we shall see each other in 2015 , hopefully with nice weather , on either 30 August , or on another weekend , &quot; the riders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to Münsterland , and the organizers will plan a repeat .
Konstantin Wecker - scrupulously honest memoirs
the 287 @-@ page &quot; Monk and Warrior &quot; by Konstantin Wecker , song writer , pacifist , political activist and ex @-@ prisoner , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a biography
composed more as a collection of thought @-@ provoking ideas rather than a chronological history , the author , who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947 , has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable song @-@ text .
and he has been unstintingly honest throughout : from masturbating as a grammar school pupil to shoplifting and drug @-@ taking , he has left none of his human weaknesses untold .
and this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man .
as a result , abstract concepts , which he liberally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : love ; Soul ; Ego ; Existing in the Here and Now ; Spirituality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosophical , but also very personal way .
and he explains why he is pacifist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moulded - not only by music ( he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musician ) but by his prison experience , too .
he says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks , who live their lives by a process of &quot; subtraction &quot; whereby they &quot; rid themselves of all things superfluous . &quot;
in @-@ between all the highbrow stuff , there are also short anecdotes of a more earthy nature - for example , fist @-@ fights in a bar frequented by GIs , or else a crazy drive on the motorway , in which he drove full @-@ on straight into a tree .
and he &apos;s unsparing also , as he describes that too .
lenny Henry : my father never hugged me .
never said &quot; I love you &quot;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing a comedy , Rudy &apos;s Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
the soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat .
but Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
there was &quot; a lot &quot; of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father .
he was very unknowable .
you never saw his face , you just heard his voice : &apos; stop the noise .
leave your sister alone .
move !
I want to watch the cricket .
my older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown @-@ up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stroke in cricket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
he was this unsmiling bloke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and , although conditions were better than in his father &apos;s day , he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him .
it &apos;s a bit brighter now but they &apos;re dark , smoky , Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot .
my dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you &apos;d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him .
when I walked round it , I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estimation of him went up .
none the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection .
my dad never did hugging , never said , &apos; I love you &apos; .
it wasn &apos;t until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying &apos; I love you , I love you , I love you .
having a daughter of his own , Billie , with Dawn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
could you stop with the &quot; I love you &quot; ?
just stop hugging me !
dad , I &apos;m 22 !
with Dawn French .
why wouldn &apos;t I be friends with her ?
she &apos;s a great mum
he &apos;s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
dawn &apos;s a good person .
why wouldn &apos;t I be friends with Dawn ?
she &apos;s a great mum .
Henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic .
it was one of the things that killed her .
so when I became very , very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms , my doctor said , &apos; You &apos;ve got to be radical .
so I went on a big fitness thing , and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it &apos;s very hard .
and it &apos;s tedious .
nobody likes eating carrots .
Henry &apos;s change in career trajectory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , close @-@ cropped beard .
since he won critical acclaim for his Othello , he has become engrossed in the theatre .
comedy of Errors followed , as did Fences by August Wilson .
it &apos;s a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life .
he started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
a DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him .
his TV career was launched in the mid @-@ Seventies : &quot; for quite a long time I was the only black impressionist / comedian on telly . &quot;
he learnt on the job .
not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient joke @-@ delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
lenny on New Faces in 1975
because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show , a light entertainment programme in which people &quot; blacked up , &quot; Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years .
my family were very uncomfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I don &apos;t regret that I did it .
although it was a weird , reprehensible position to be in , I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd .
but what was an &quot; award @-@ winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties .
the first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984 , and in the Nineties he was known as , among other things , chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef ! .
advertisements , documentaries , TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , LennyHenry.tv , he thought : &quot; what are you going to do next , Len , because it all feels a bit like you &apos;re marking time or you &apos;re slightly going sideways . &quot;
what came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
the first was on Shakespeare .
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare .
I wasn &apos;t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle @-@ class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front .
so I was very frightened of it .
everybody we interviewed on that show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench , said , &apos; You should try it .
don &apos;t slag it off if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
get some of the words in your mouth and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was hooked .
it gave me the feeling that I could do it .
it &apos;s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
&apos;This is what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
so the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car crash and it didn &apos;t quite happen .
soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors .
suddenly I &apos;m at the National Theatre and I just couldn &apos;t quite believe it .
there was one moment where I thought , &apos; Oh , you &apos;ve changed . &quot; &quot;
there was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained .
&quot; a little voice inside me said , &apos; You &apos;re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . &quot; &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I walked off the stage and something in me went , &quot; Oh , thank God . &quot;
it &apos;s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
&apos;You &apos;re in a play , stay in character . &quot; &quot;
Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
learning his lines for Fences was challenging .
panic &apos;s quite good , it stiffens the sinews .
that was well received too , so it &apos;s like a big sign from the gods , saying , &apos; This is what you should be doing . &quot; &quot;
he says this , of course , in a booming voice .
so I &apos;m sticking with it .
I &apos;m really loving it .
I love being in a rehearsal room .
Henry still has a comedian &apos;s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions .
I &apos;m just choosing not to do stand @-@ up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous .
if you &apos;re constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall .
I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to , but generally it doesn &apos;t float my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he &apos;ll ever do another stand @-@ up tour .
the joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever want to give that up .
so this is his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
it &apos;s good fun .
you &apos;re always telling a story and that &apos;s a great place to be .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemeni capital
in the conflict between the shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemen government , the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital , Sanaa .
Houthi supporters had occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday , said a spokesman of the Houthi party &quot; Ansar Allah . &quot;
access to the parliament was blocked as well .
Yemeni media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital .
according to a report in the on @-@ line edition of the newspaper &quot; Yemen Post &quot; Houthi leader Abdulmalik al @-@ Huthi called for these actions on Sunday evening .
the report said that Huthi threatened further escalation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
the shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence fro the sunni @-@ ruled Yemen , and are demanding that the government resign .
according to the report , Houthi tribes have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels had set up protest camps on the major access routes to Sanaa .
in the surrounding areas of the town , bloody clashes with the Yemeni army have continued unabated .
Kenya registers civil servants to target &apos; ghost workers&apos;
Kenya has started biometrically registering all civil servants in an attempt to remove &quot; ghost workers &quot; from the government &apos;s payroll .
employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
the government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
an audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1m ( £ 700,000 ) a month was lost in payments to &quot; ghost workers &quot; and other financial malpractice .
the government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC &apos;s Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital , Nairobi .
all public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise , a government statement said .
anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll , it said .
&quot; this exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of &apos; ghost workers &apos; , &quot; said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning .
the scandal surrounding arts advisor , Helge Achenbach , will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November .
five heirs of Berthold Albrecht , the son of the founder of Aldi , Theo Albrecht , are suing Achenbach and two of his companies , who are in the process of declaring themselves bankrupt , for 19.4 million euros compensation in a civil case brought before the Düsseldorf district court .
the news was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday .
according to the statement of claim , when purchasing the works of art and antique cars , Achenbach conned them , and invoiced Berthold Albrecht for more than the actual sales price .
in so doing , the agreed commission also turned out to be more .
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros .
children need roots and wings
he was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
during his teaching time , Manfred Richter got to know many schoolchildren who are now fully @-@ grown adults living in Petershausen and Kollbach .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
Mount Sněžka is one of the best @-@ known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordböhmen , today &apos;s Trutnov .
he was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years .
one year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train .
that was how he came to live in Senkendorf , in Upper Franconia .
the teacher training course was in Bamberg .
in order to get to the school , Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station ; take the train to Bamberg ; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
after two months . Manfred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in Bamberg , in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
in 1951 , he took his first state exam , and his second in 1954 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
since Upper Franconia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach .
the &quot; Young Women &apos;s Room &quot; was his first &quot; Service Flat &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 , he moved into the new @-@ build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three @-@ room service flat .
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968 .
until then , the school district association of Petershausen @-@ Kollbach had three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen .
in the school year of 1968 / 69 , these classes were accommodated in Petershausen , in today &apos;s town hall .
when the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded , the only school left in the locality was the primary school .
in order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school , the then dean , Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
however , Petershausen continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from September 1982 onwards , could move into the present @-@ day building , which has since been extended , after Richter took his retirement .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor , Ludwig Götz , who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work @-@ room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school @-@ building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
&quot; Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school , &quot; recalls Richter , with gratitude .
throughout his whole career , Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice : &quot; one should never forget to love . &quot; Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; one has to give children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84 year @-@ old .
but experience has also taught him that : &quot; one doesn &apos;t always achieve that . &quot; whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children , is unclear .
in any case , Richter &apos;s methods were at times unconventional .
if school children got into fights , they were not given punishments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a detention .
at the cost of the council , Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves , and then let the two antagonists fight it out , even if this did occasionally produce a black @-@ eye .
for the benefit of the school , Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor , Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
following his retirement , Richter , who had no political allegiances , was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996 .
however , Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU .

hr4 @-@ CYCLE TOUR 700 cyclists are taking a breather in the health resort of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
there is nothing particular out of the ordinary about touring cyclists take a rest in Bad Salzhausen or in Schotten .
however , on Friday , the sheer numbers of those resting up was striking : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour , together with their entourages , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen , and they would later be attending an open air party in the Alteburgpark in Schotten , too .
under the logo &quot; Cycling and celebrating along the newly @-@ discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig , &quot; the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker &amp; Band .
on Friday it was down to business : the riders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then further on to Schotten .
in Bad Salzhausen , the sportsmen @-@ and @-@ women were greeted by mayor Hans @-@ Peter Seum , who had ridden off the start @-@ line in Bad Vilbel on his own bike , and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen , Petra Schwing @-@ Döring .
all sorts of food and drink had been prepared , to refresh body and mind : the local women from Ranstadt and Nieder @-@ Mockstadt had baked 85 apple- , plum- and cheesecakes - as well as streusel cake which the intrepid riders let melt in their mouths .
&quot; such cakes only the local women can make , &quot; praised the rider from Aulendiebach , at the same time as he ordered another slice .
at the drinks stand of the Geiß @-@ Nidda gymnasium club , the riders could acquire cold drinks .
the &quot; Duo Bravo &quot; entertained the visitors with well @-@ known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause .
the lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect .
one gentleman even received a head @-@ massage from his lady partner : &quot; he certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . &quot;
meanwhile , the mayor and the company boss still had work to do : they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the watering @-@ hole inn , the Trinkkurhaus , by reporter , Rainer Janke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thumbs up for Bad Salzhausen .
even head of promotions , Tobias Hagen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
his pick @-@ up truck , in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15 @-@ strong Hessen Police team ; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
&quot; the majority of riders come from the Rhein @-@ Main @-@ Region , &quot; he explained , &quot; but riders have also come from Gießen and Fulda , from Lauterbach or from the Taunus and even from many towns in Westfalia .
the number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
category 1 riders are accommodated in hotels , with Category 2 riders being put up in hostel @-@ style lodging .
as the riders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort : &quot; bye ! &quot;
&quot; it was very nice in Bad Salzhausen ! &quot; they shouted , as they waved goodbye .
after arriving in Schotten , the group could take a short rest .
but then in the evening , the riders were requested to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark .
under the guidance of manager of the Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing ( GTS ) the Park had acquired a lovely festive ambience and , of course , there were plenty of nice nibbles , such as Flammkuchen with well @-@ chilled Federweißer wine , too .
Mayoress Susanne Schaab , GTS @-@ boss , Markus Hoßfeld and MSC @-@ Chairman , Wolfgang Wagner @-@ Sachs , in his capacity as board member of the Hessen @-@ Thüringen section of the ADAC welcomed the visitors .
the three were visibly delighted by the &quot; roaring trade in Schotten . &quot;
DJ Tobias Hagen opened the dancing stage .
the cyclists were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting feats on their bicycles earlier in the day .
